# Examples of beautiful applications

This repository contains examples of beautiful screens of some famous applications.
The only difference is that these examples use the [Kivy](https://github.com/kivy/kivy) framework and the [KivyMD](https://github.com/kivymd/KivyMD) library.
Some examples are described in articles on the [Habrabar](https://habr.com/ru/users/kivymd/) programmers forum (in Russian).
